        It had been a simple realization that had changed Debra's life
        perspective. It was really so simple that she was embarrassed that she
        had lived the previous five years with the way she measured her worth.
        Now that she saw what she had been doing, she could see how sad it was.
        That made her all the more relieved she had made the change. The number
        of hearts her Instagram posts received wasn't any longer the indication
        of her own self-worth.
